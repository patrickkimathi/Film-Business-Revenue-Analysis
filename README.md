🧭 4. Actionable Recommendations
📌 1. Strengthen Underperforming Chains

Chain C needs process optimization, pricing review, or marketing support.

Introduce targeted weekend offers where this chain struggles most.

📌 2. Amplify Promotions That Drive Sales

Expand BOGO and Festival bundles across all regions.
Reassess student discounts or promote them during low-traffic hours.

📌 3. Invest Strategically in Regional Marketing

Prioritize England for premium product launches.
Boost campaigns in Wales to capture untapped revenue.

📌 4. Enhance Out-of-Town Cinema Experience

Since in-town locations outperform, out-of-town branches may need
Better accessibility
Targeted neighborhood marketing
Improved occupancy-based pricing (dynamic pricing)

📌 5. Optimize Ad Expenditure

Identify unnecessary ad spending and shift to data-driven channels.
